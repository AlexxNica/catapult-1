# Release Management Configuration-User File
# the untracked configuration-user.yml file drives user specific settings to save time during localDev provisioning
# if configuration-user.yml does not exist is is automatically generated from configuration-user.yml.example
# any vagrant command will inspect configuration-user.yml.example against configuration-user.yml, if new setting are available, the vagrant command will halt and provide instructions to move foreward

settings:
  version: "0.1"
  git_pull: true                #save time during redhat provision by skipping git pulls but retaining the repo clones and repo cleanups
  production_rsync: true        #save time during redhat provision by skipping rsync from production
  software_validation: true     #save time during redhat provision by skipping wp-cli and drush information per web instance
